  this was a sample problem from an old Amazon.com
exercise of sorts. You have a bunch of IPs the dots
are missing so how can you possibly recover the
ipaddresses? I did it simply by biting off possible
ranges, but you can do better by looking at and
eliminating IPs that would be internal or some
other method like that.

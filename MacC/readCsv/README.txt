 testLexisCSV.c  reads a file called in.csv, it will parse the tokens and put
data values next to the row heading you would see in MS Excel. I am not sure 
why this was done but meh. I think I was trying to make test data. I am 
pretty sure there is a bug floating around here as well but it may be better
than the last csv parser. I do have a m,uch better one floating around but it
will take some time to dig up.

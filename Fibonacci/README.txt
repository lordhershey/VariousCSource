  Various programs to compute a large Fibonacci Number,
they are slow and use large files. Was figuring out how to
compute millionth number. The source bigfib3.c probably has
to be compiled using 64 bits, I did not try to make use of 
standard definitions. I do not remember. Just use GCC compile
line to build exe - I did not bother with a make file.
